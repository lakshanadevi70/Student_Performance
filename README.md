# Student_Performance

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts students’ final grades using multiple regression based on features like study hours, attendance, previous scores, and lifestyle factors. 

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (Multiple Linear Regression)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Analysis
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train multiple regression model to predict final grades
- Visualizations showing relationships between features and performance 


## 📂 Dataset
Student performance dataset (e.g., UCI / Kaggle student grades with hours studied, demographics, and more)

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand real-world regression workflows including data loading, cleaning, feature analysis, visualization, and drawing insights on what factors most affect student performance.
